# CaliburnTreeView
Caliburn Micro TreeView HierarchicalDataTemplate with DataTemplate example

This allow you to create a MDI version of a selectable Left Column of Data in a tree view, and change the view in the left hand side.
This is PURE demo, have a read over the Caliburn.Micro Documnets to learn about conductors and screens.

Am coming back to the project to update for Maui..
